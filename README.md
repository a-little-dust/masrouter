# [ACL 2025] MasRouter: Learning to Route LLMs for Multi-Agent Systems

## 📰 News

- 🎉 Updates (2025-5-15) MasRouter is accpected to ACL 2025 Main!
- 🚩 Updates (2025-2-16) Initial upload to arXiv [PDF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11133).


## 🤔 Why MasRouter?

**MasRouter** expands LLM routing to the multi-agent systems (MAS) *for the first time*. It leverages the powerful reasoning capabilities of LLM MAS, while also making it relatively cost-effective.

## 👋🏻 Method Overview

**MasRouter** integrates all components of MAS into a unified routing framework. It employs collaboration mode determination, role allocation, and LLM routing through a cascaded controller network, progressively constructing a MAS that balances effectiveness and efficiency.

## 🏃‍♂️‍➡️ Quick Start

### 📊 Datasets

Please download the  `GSM8K`,  `HumanEval`, `MATH`, `MBPP`, `MMLU` datasets and place it in the `Datasets` folder. The file structure should be organized as follows:
```
Datasets
└── gsm8k
    └── gsm8k.jsonl
└── humaneval
    └── humaneval-py.jsonl
└── MATH
    └── test
    └── train
└── mbpp
    └── mbpp.jsonl
└── MMLU
    └── data
```

### 🔑 Add API keys

Add API keys in `template.env` and change its name to `.env`. We recommend that this API be able to access multiple LLMs.
```python
URL = "" # the URL of LLM backend
KEY = "" # the key for API
```

### 🐹 Run the code

The code below verifies the experimental results of the `mbpp` dataset.

```bash
python experiments/run_mbpp.py
```
